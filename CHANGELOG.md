# Changelog

All notable changes to the HoneyBee Browser are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **State pseudo-classes** (ADR-018): `:link`, `:visited`, and `:hover`
  now parse, match, and render. `<a href>` links render blue when
  unvisited, purple when visited, and lighter blue when hovered --
  matching the behavior of every mainstream browser since the mid-1990s.
- **Click navigation** (ADR-018): clicking a rendered `<a href>` now
  navigates to it. Before this, links were styled but inert and the
  only way to load a page was typing in the URL bar.
- **`honeybee::resolve_url`** in `base/url.{hpp,cpp}` -- one canonical
  implementation used by both the CSS matcher (to decide whether a
  link's target is visited) and the browser layer (to fetch on click),
  guaranteeing the string marked visited is byte-identical to the
  string fetched.
- **`renderer::layout::hit_test`** -- maps mouse coordinates to the
  deepest DOM element under the point, walking the layout tree and
  inspecting `LineFragment::element` for flattened inline text.
- **`LineFragment::element`** -- carries source-element identity
  through inline layout so `<a>` inside `<p>` remains identifiable
  for hit-testing and future per-element features (text selection,
  tooltips).
- **`RenderState`** threaded through the cascade -- `visited_urls`,
  `hovered_element`, `base_url` all travel with `cascade()` so the
  selector matcher can consult them.
- `tests/fixtures/` not yet introduced; manual test HTML files
  currently live in `docs/` (see `docs/README.md`).

### Fixed

- **Use-after-free segfault on click-navigation** (ADR-018): after
  clicking a link while hovering over it, the browser crashed when
  the new page finished loading. Root cause: `RenderState::hovered_element`
  pointed into the previous DOM; `RenderPipeline::render()` replaced
  `doc_` without clearing the pointer, and the next cascade's
  `PseudoHover` matcher dereferenced freed memory. Fixed at the source
  in `render()`, where `doc_` is the only place replaced.

### Changed

- UA stylesheet rule `a { color: #0000EE }` replaced by three
  per-pseudo-class rules (`a:link`, `a:visited`, `a:hover`). Side
  effect: `<a>` without an `href` no longer renders blue (correct --
  it is not a link).
- `resolve_url` relocated from `selectors.cpp`'s anonymous namespace
  to `base/url.cpp` so both the CSS layer and the browser layer share
  one implementation.

## [0.4.0]

The baseline release at the time this changelog was created. Prior
history lives in the git log and in `docs/decisions/` (ADRs 001-017
implemented before this file existed).
